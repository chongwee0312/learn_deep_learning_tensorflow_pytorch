# Introduction
Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose. Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.

According to World Health Organization (WHO), 
- The number of people with diabetes rose from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014. Prevalence has been rising more rapidly in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries.
- Diabetes is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation.
- Between 2000 and 2019, there was a 3% increase in diabetes mortality rates by age.
- In 2019, diabetes and kidney disease due to diabetes caused an estimated 2 million deaths.

In conclusion, diabetes poses a substantial global health burden, necessitating comprehensive and collaborative efforts to address its prevalence, associated complications, and mortality rates. It is crucial to prioritise preventative measures, early diagnosis, and accessible healthcare to mitigate the impact of diabetes on individuals and communities worldwide.

# Purpose
This project aims to build a classification model to detect diabetes for early diagnosis.

# Data

**Description of data**

*Features*
- `gender`: The gender of the individual.
- `age`: The age of the individual.
- `Hypertension`: A binary indicator that signifies whether the individual has hypertension (high blood pressure).
- `heart_disease`: A binary indicator that indicates whether the individual has a history of heart disease.
- `smoking_history`: A category variable which indicates whether the individual is currently a smoker.
- `bmi`: Stands for body mass index, a measure of body fat based on the height and weight, providing insights into the individual's weight status.
- `HbA1c_level`: Represents the level of HbA1c, a glycated hemoglobin that reflects average blood glucose levels over the past few months. This is a crucial marker for diabetes management.
- `blood_glucose_level`: Indicates the current blood glucose level, which is a key parameter in diabetes diagnosis and monitoring.

*Target*
- `diabetes`: The target variable which indicates whether the individual has diabetes or not.ence of diabetes.
